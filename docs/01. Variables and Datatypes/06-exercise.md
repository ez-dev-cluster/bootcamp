# Exercise

### 1. Integer (`int`) Exercise:
**Task:** Create a program that asks the user to input two integers, then calculates and displays their sum, difference, product, and quotient (division).

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.Write("Enter the first integer: ");
        int num1 = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

        // ...
    }
}
```

### 2. Double (`double`) Exercise:
**Task:** Write a program that asks the user for the radius of a circle (as a double) and then calculates and displays the area and circumference of the circle.

Formula:
- Area = π * r²
- Circumference = 2 * π * r

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

### 3. Boolean (`bool`) Exercise:
**Task:** Create a program that asks the user for their age and checks if they are eligible to vote (18 years or older). Print "Eligible to vote" if true and "Not eligible to vote" if false.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

### 4. String (`string`) Exercise:
**Task:** Create a program that asks the user for their first and last name, then prints a greeting message using string concatenation and interpolation.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

### 5. Char (`char`) Exercise:
**Task:** Write a program that asks the user to enter a single character and checks if it is a vowel or consonant. Assume the input is a letter.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

These exercises cover basic operations and concepts for each of the specified types (`int`, `double`, `bool`, `string`, and `char`). Let me know if you'd like more or specific types of exercises!
